## 📦 Exporting functions & variables in React
### ✅ Named export
* Syntax:
  ```js
  export { componentName };
  ```
* Multiple named exports are allowed from a single file.
* Import using curly braces:

  ```js
  import { componentName } from './file';
  ```
---

### ⭐ Default export
* Syntax:
  ```js
  export default componentName;
  ```
* Only **one** default export per file.
* Import without braces:
  ```js
  import componentName from './file';
  ```

## 🧠 Variables in React
1. **Normal variable**
   Just like standard JavaScript variables.
2. **State variable**
   * Created using React hooks like `useState`.
   * Has “superpowers”: when updated, React **automatically re-renders** the component.
---
## ⚙ React Hooks
Hooks are special **utility functions** provided by React:
* `useState()` – for state management.
* `useEffect()` – for side effects (like fetching data, subscriptions, etc.).

> Hooks help add React features to functional components.
